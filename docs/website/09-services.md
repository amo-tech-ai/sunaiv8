# 09. Services Page Strategy Summary

**Route:** `/services`
**Purpose:** Central decision hub for prospective clients.

## 🏗 Structural Strategy

1.  **Hero:** "Systems, Not Tools". Positions Sun AI as an engineering partner, not a dev shop.
2.  **Capabilities:** "What We Build". Granular breakdown (Agents, Workflows, Wizards) to show technical depth.
3.  **Approach:** "Systems Before AI". Emphasizes the "Controller Gate" and production readiness.
4.  **Core Services:** "The Menu". 6 distinct tracks (Web Dev, Custom AI, Agents, etc.) linking to deep dives.
5.  **Industry Solutions:** "Verticals". Quick self-identification for leads (SaaS, Healthcare, etc.).
6.  **Agent Architecture:** "The 10-Agent System". Visualizing the complexity we manage so the client doesn't have to.
7.  **Tech Stack:** Minimal credibility strip.
8.  **CTA:** High-contrast conversion block.

## 🎨 Design Execution
- **Layout:** High whitespace, editorial typography (Playfair/Inter).
- **Navigation:** Deep-linking anchors (`#core-services`, `#industries`).
- **Visuals:** Icons for capabilities, flow diagram for Agent System.
- **Conversion:** "Start Project" wizard is the primary destination.

## ✅ Status
- **Strategy:** Completed.
- **Implementation:** Completed (`ServicesPage.tsx`).
- **Verification:** Pending review.
