### 🤖 Multistep Prompt: Services
> "Create a 2x3 grid of service cards. Each card: borderless glassmorphism style, thin 1px white border (10% opacity). Icons should be minimalist SVG line-art with emerald gradients. Hover effect: The card lifts 8px and the background opacity increases. Add a 'Signals' sub-section to each card showing a 1-sentence ROI example in italicized serif."

## 3. How It Works: The 7-Phase Timeline
**Visual:** A horizontal scroll-triggered timeline with "Drawing" line effect.
**Steps:** Discovery → Design → Frontend → Backend → AI Logic → Polish → Launch.

### 🤖 Multistep Prompt: Timeline
> "Implement a horizontal scroll-triggered timeline. As the user scrolls, a thin emerald line draws from left to right, connecting 7 phase nodes. Each node expands on scroll into a detailed card: Phase Number (Serif), Title (Sans Bold), and 'Agent Assigned' (e.g. Planner Agent). Use a parallax effect where the cards move slightly faster than the line."

Cross-fade transition between slides every 8 seconds. Below the quote, show the 'ROI Metric' (e.g. +32% AOV) in a high-contrast emerald box."
